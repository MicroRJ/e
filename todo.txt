Welcome to 'e' the totally unfinished and barebones
text editor. (Use 'e' at your own risk)

BINDINGS:
<ctrl-UP   >   to scroll up
<ctrl-DOWN > to scroll down
<ctrl-o    >    to open a file (file-picker)
<ctrl-s    >    to save a buffer (file-picker)
<ctrl-F5   >   to rebuild
<ctrl-F1   >   to save (override)
<ctrl-SHIFT>
<UP        >   move up
<DOWN      >   move down
<LEFT      >   move left
<RIGHT     >   move right

TODO:
cmd re-routing
* better and faster buffer
* better formatting that takes into account existing whitespace (avoid extra indentation)
* line wrapping
* x scrolling
* better shortcuts, (far manager style)
* auto-save
* multicursor support [%70]
* scroll bar
* support for scrolling with mouse wheel
* autocomplete would also be cool
* grammar correction would be really cool
* better and faster text highlighting
* overall better rendering backend
* better text rendering (better alignment) and also faster text rendering
(currently not efficient at all)
* fullscreen/window_resize support
* improve cpu usage
* better text navigation
* support for external config files
* introduce workspaces (project config)
* multibuffer support
* buffer window events, otherwise we risk missing them
* render the indentation to know the difference between whitespace and it
* better indentation mechanic that takes into account white space added
* support for ttf fonts
* convert indentation to white space
