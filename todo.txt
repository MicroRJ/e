 TIMENTE MORTEM, OMNIA TIMEO

#todo
Problably revist font rendering, surely it could be done
much better.

Welcome to 'e' the totally unfinished and barebones
text editor. (Use 'e' at your own risk)

BINDINGS:
NONE, there are no bindings!

TODO:
cmd re-routing
* better and faster buffer
* better formatting that takes into account existing whitespace (avoid extra indentation)
* line wrapping
* x scrolling
* better shortcuts, (far manager style)
* auto-save
* multicursor support [%70]
* scroll bar
* support for scrolling with mouse wheel
* autocomplete would also be cool
* grammar correction would be really cool
* better and faster text highlighting
* overall better rendering backend
* better text rendering (better alignment) and also faster text rendering
(currently not efficient at all)
* fullscreen/window_resize support
* improve cpu usage
* better text navigation
* support for external config files
* introduce workspaces (project config)
* multibuffer support
* buffer window events, otherwise we risk missing them
* render the indentation to know the difference between whitespace and it
* better indentation mechanic that takes into account white space added
* support for ttf fonts
* convert indentation to white space
