Welcome to 'e' the totally unfinished and barebones
text editor. (Use 'e' at your own risk)

BINDINGS:
<ctrl-UP>   to scroll up
<ctrl-DOWN> to scroll down
<ctrl-o>    to open a file (file-picker)
<ctrl-s>    to save a buffer (file-picker)
<ctrl-p>    for the command processor (limited commands)


TODO:
cmd re-routing
* better and faster buffer (gap buffer)
* better formatting that takes into account existing whitespace 
	(avoid extra indentation)
* line wrapping
* auto-save
* multicursor support
* scroll bar
* support for scrolling with mouse wheel
* autocomplete would also be cool
* grammar correction would be really cool
* better and faster text highlighting
* overall better rendering backend
* better text rendering (better alignment) and also faster text rendering
(currently not efficient at all)
fullscreen/window_resize support
improve cpu usage
better text navigation
support for external config files
introduce workspaces (project config)
multibuffer support
buffer window events, otherwise we risk missing them
render the indentation to know the difference between whitespace and it
support for other fonts
better indentation mechanic that takes into account white space added
convert indentation to white space
